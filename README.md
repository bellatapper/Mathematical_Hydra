# Mathematical hydra

## Description

In this game the mission of the player is to defeat a mathematical hydra. The player will play as Hercules and use a sword to cut off the heads belonging to the hydra. However, Hercules is only allowed to cut of the external heads. Furthermore, once a head gets cut off, the hydra automatically generates two additional copies of the portion starting from the grand parent head. This applies unless the particular head is directly attatched to the body of the hydra, in this case the head is cut off but no copies are generated.

**Features of the game**

The features are today:
1. Mouse cursor representing a sword </br>
2. Background picture with simple instructions to the player.

Enhancement we would like to add: 
1. Narrator voice and written indroduction, including background and the rules of the game </br>
2. Option to choose level of difficulty by choosing amongst three hydras </br>
4. Audio effects </br>
